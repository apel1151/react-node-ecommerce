# react-node-ecommerce

This is a full-stack ecommerce application using react and nodejs. MongoDB is used for database.
I demonstrated this whole project in two folders. UI design is in ecommerce_frontend folder and database, server, api connection are in ecommerce_backend. 
I've used mongodb, express, jwt, stripe payment method for the backend. 
This project is under developed. I'm still working on this project.
